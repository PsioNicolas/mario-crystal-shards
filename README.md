# Mario 64: The Crystal Shards

This hack is a work in progress. I've made a version of this hack in the past that's up on romhacking.com, but I plan to work on this one for a long time. This is a clone of the [HackerSM64](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64) repo.

## Tasks to complete

- [ ] Custom Mario that looks like it was drawn by Adeleine
- [ ] Levels
- [ ] Power-ups
- [ ] Animated cutscenes
